Test complexity guidelines:

UI Simple:
- Few fields
- Minimal validations
- Low execution effort
- Junior QA skill

UI Medium:
- Multiple workflows
- Validations
- Moderate execution effort
- Mid-level QA skill

UI Complex:
- Complex business logic
- Integrations
- High execution effort
- Senior QA skill

API:
- Request/response validation
- Auth, negative cases
- Medium effort
- Automation-friendly

Cost logic (qualitative):
- Higher skill → higher hourly cost
- Higher complexity → higher maintenance
- Automation saves cost over multiple cycles
